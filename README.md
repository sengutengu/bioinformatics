# Coursera Bioinformatics Files

A place to put my course files for Coursera's [Genomic Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science). I am hoping to complete the specialization piece by piece by the end of summer 2025.

I began working on the [Bioinformatics specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics), but there are errors in their Cogniterra platform that do not allow assignment submissions, so I switched.

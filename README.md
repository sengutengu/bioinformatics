# Coursera Bioinformatics Files

A place to put my course files for Coursera's [Bioinformatics specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). I am hoping to complete the specialization piece by piece by the end of summer 2025.

As I work on this repository, I think I'd like it to be a resource for other students taking the Bioinformatics specialization, especially since the course content is quite tough and not always explained clearly. If you are looking at my repository and would like to contribute, please feel free.
